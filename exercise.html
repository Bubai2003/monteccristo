            The Count of Monte Cristo (French: Le Comte de Monte-Cristo) is an adventure novel written by French author Alexandre Dumas (père) completed in 1844. It is one of the author's most popular works, along with The Three Musketeers. Like many of his novels, it was expanded from plot outlines suggested by his collaborating ghostwriter Auguste Maquet.[1]

The story takes place in France, Italy, and islands in the Mediterranean during the historical events of 1815–1839: the era of the Bourbon Restoration through the reign of Louis-Philippe of France. It begins on the day that Napoleon left his first island of exile, Elba, beginning the Hundred Days period when Napoleon returned to power. The historical setting is a fundamental element of the book, an adventure story centrally concerned with themes of hope, justice, vengeance, mercy, and forgiveness.

Before he can marry his fiancée Mercédès, Edmond Dantès, a French nineteen-year-old first mate of the Pharaon, is falsely accused of treason, arrested, and imprisoned without trial in the Château d'If, a grim island fortress off Marseille. A fellow prisoner, Abbé Faria, correctly deduces that romantic rival Fernand Mondego, envious crewmate Danglars, and double-dealing magistrate De Villefort are responsible. Over the course of their long imprisonment, Faria educates Dantès and tells him of a cache of treasure he found. After Faria dies, Dantès escapes and finds the treasure. As the powerful and mysterious Count of Monte Cristo, he enters the fashionable Parisian world of the 1830s to avenge himself.

The book is considered a literary classic today. According to Lucy Sante, "The Count of Monte Cristo has become a fixture of Western civilization's literature."

    On the day in 1815 when Napoleon escapes from Elba, Edmond Dantès sails the Pharaon into Marseille after the death of the captain, Leclère. The ship's owner, Morrel, will make Dantès the next captain. On his deathbed, Leclère charged Dantès to deliver a package to General Bertrand (exiled with Napoleon), and a letter from Elba to an unknown man in Paris.

Crewmate Danglars is jealous of Dantès' rapid promotion. On the eve of Dantès' wedding to his Catalan fiancée Mercédès, Danglars meets Fernand Mondego, Mercédès' cousin and a rival for her affections, and the two hatch a plot to anonymously accuse him of being a Bonapartist. Dantès' neighbor, Caderousse, is present; he too is jealous of Dantès, but although he objects to the plot, he becomes too drunk to prevent it.

Dantès is arrested, and the cowardly Caderousse stays silent. Villefort, the deputy crown prosecutor in Marseille, destroys the letter from Elba when he discovers that it is addressed to his own father, Noirtier, a Bonapartist, knowing it would destroy his own political career. To silence Dantès, he condemns him without trial to life imprisonment. After the Hundred Days, Napoleon is defeated, and Louis XVIII is restored to the throne.
After six years of solitary imprisonment in the Château d'If, Dantès is on the verge of suicide when the Abbé Faria, a middle-aged Italian prisoner, digs an escape tunnel that by mistake ends in Dantès' cell. Faria reveals he is a priest and scholar. He had been imprisoned in 1807 after participating in political upheavals over the unification of Italy and brought to the Château d'If in 1811.

Over the next eight years, Faria educates Dantès in languages, history, culture, mathematics, chemistry, medicine, and science. Knowing himself to be close to death from catalepsy, Faria tells Dantès the location of a vast treasure hidden on the island of Monte Cristo, which he discovered by deciphering a letter from Cardinal Cesare Spada to his nephew and heir; both men were poisoned by Pope Alexander VI (the father of Cesare and Lucrezia Borgia). Faria was on his way to retrieve the treasure, but was captured by the Italian authorities.

On 28 February 1829, Faria dies. Dantès takes the body to his cell and takes its place in the burial sack. When he is thrown into the sea, Dantès cuts through the sack and swims to a nearby island, where he is rescued by Genoese smugglers. He joins the ship's crew.

Months later, he locates and retrieves the treasure. Dantès returns to Marseille in search of information for his vengeance. He later purchases the island of Monte Cristo and the title of count from the Tuscan government.

Travelling as the Abbé Busoni, Dantès meets Caderousse, now married and living in poverty, who regrets not intervening in Dantès' arrest. Caderousse informs him that Mercédès had resigned herself, after eighteen months of waiting for Dantès' return, to marrying Fernand, with whom she has a son, Albert. Caderousse names Danglars and Mondego as the men who betrayed him, and also that Dantès' father died of self-inflicted starvation. Both Danglars and Mondego have prospered greatly. Danglars became a speculator, amassed a fortune and married the wealthy widow Madame de Norgonne. Mondego served in the French Army, rising to the rank of lieutenant-colonel in 1829. Dantès rewards Caderousse with a diamond.

Learning that his old employer Morrel faces bankruptcy, Dantès, posing as a representative of the firm of Thomson and French, buys Morrel's debts and gives him three months reprieve. At the end of the three months and with no way to repay his debts, Morrel is about to commit suicide when he learns that they have been mysteriously paid and that one of his lost ships has returned with a full cargo, secretly rebuilt and laden by Dantès.

    Dantès reappears nine years later, in <i>1838</i>, as the mysterious, fabulously wealthy Count of Monte Cristo. Mondego is now the Count de Morcerf, Danglars a baron and banker, and Villefort a procureur du roi (prosecutor for the king).

In Rome, at Carnival time, Dantès arranges for Viscount Albert de Morcerf, the son of Mercédès and Mondego, to be captured by the bandit Luigi Vampa. Dantès "rescues" the boy, who introduces the Count to Parisian society. Dantès dazzles Danglars with his wealth, persuading him to extend him a credit of six million francs (approximately €13.1 billion in 2021). Dantès meets Mercédès for the first time in 23 years; she does not seem to recognize him.


Actor James O'Neill as the Abbé Busoni
Dantès purchases a home in Auteuil, a quarter of Paris. When his servant, a Corsican called Bertuccio, becomes nervous at the house, Dantès makes him explain why. Bertuccio reveals he had an older brother who raised him after they became orphaned. Bertuccio's brother was ambushed and killed in 1815 in Nîmes, where Villefort presided. His brother's death left him and his brother's widow, Assunta, destitute, which forced him to take up smuggling. Bertuccio demanded Villefort prosecute the killers, but he refused. When Bertuccio threatened Villefort, the latter asked to be transferred.

Bertuccio tracked Villefort to Auteuil, eventually finding him in late September 1815, the day when Madame Danglars, then a widow, delivered their illegitimate child in the house that the Count later purchased from Villefort's father-in-law. To cover up the affair, Villefort told Madame Danglars that the infant was stillborn, smothered the child and buried him in a box with a piece of linen cloth—which revealed his noble descent—(inscribed with the letters "H" and "N", later revealed as indicating Hermine of Norgonne) in the garden. During the secret burial, Bertuccio stabbed Villefort, unearthed the child and resuscitated him after fleeing. He left the child at a Paris asylum. After recovering from his wound, Villefort was ordered to the South. Later, Villefort tracked the baby to the asylum where Bertuccio had left him, but was told that a woman (Assunta) in possession of half of the linen cloth had taken the baby away.

Assunta raised the child, naming him Benedetto, but the boy took up a life of crime by age 11. One day, after Assunta refused to give him money, Benedetto and two comrades tortured her, and she died from her wounds.

Bertuccio stops at Caderousse's lodging, seeking shelter. Inside, he sees Caderousse negotiating with a jeweler for the sale of the diamond given to him by Dantès. The jeweler is forced to stay the night due to a storm. That night, Caderousse kills his wife and the jeweler, then flees with both the diamond and the money. Bertuccio enters the house, but is discovered by the authorities and arrested for the murders. While in jail, Bertuccio reveals the truth to Abbé Busoni, who confirms his story. Shortly before the start of the trial, Caderousse is captured and repatriated to France, where he confesses, which leads to Bertuccio's release. He takes Abbé Busoni's advice to work for the Count.

Benedetto is sentenced to the galleys with Caderousse. After the pair are freed by Dantès, using the alias "Lord Wilmore", the Count induces Benedetto to take the identity of "Viscount Andrea Cavalcanti" and introduces him to Parisian society. Andrea ingratiates himself to Danglars, who betroths his daughter Eugénie to him, not knowing they are half-siblings, after canceling her engagement to Albert. Meanwhile, Caderousse blackmails Andrea, threatening to reveal his past if he does not share his newfound wealth. Cornered by Abbé Busoni while attempting to rob the Count's house, Caderousse begs to be given another chance. Dantès forces him to write a letter to Danglars, exposing Cavalcanti as an impostor. When Caderousse leaves the estate, he is stabbed by Andrea. Caderousse dictates a deathbed statement naming his killer, and the Count reveals his true identity to Caderousse before he dies.

The Count has published in a French newspaper how Albert's father made his fortune in Greece: by the betrayal and murder of his employer, Ali Pasha. Fernand stole Ali Pasha's fortune and sold Ali's wife Vasiliki and four-year-old daughter Haydée into slavery. Dantès purchased Haydée when she was 13. Albert blames the Count for his father's downfall and challenges him to a duel. Mercédès, having recognized Monte Cristo as Dantès, begs him to spare her son. She learns the injustices inflicted on him, but convinces him to not kill her son. Realizing that Dantès intends to let Albert kill him, she reveals the truth to Albert, which causes him to make a public apology to the Count. Albert and Mercédès disown Fernand, renounce their titles and wealth and depart to begin new lives. Albert enlists as a soldier. Fernand confronts the Count of Monte Cristo, who reveals his identity. Fernand shoots himself.

Valentine, Villefort's daughter by his first wife, stands to inherit the fortunes of her grandfather Noirtier and her mother's parents, the Saint-Mérans, while Villefort's second wife Héloïse seeks the fortune for her son Édouard. The Count is aware of Héloïse's intentions and introduces her to the techniques of poison. Héloïse poisons the Saint-Mérans, and Valentine inherits their fortune. Valentine is briefly disinherited by Noirtier in an attempt to prevent Valentine's impending marriage to Franz d'Épinay, whom she does not love; the marriage is canceled when d'Épinay learns from Noirtier that his father, whom he believed was assassinated by Bonapartists, was killed by Noirtier in a duel.

After a failed attempt on Noirtier's life, which leaves Noirtier's servant Barrois dead, Héloïse targets Valentine so that Édouard will get the fortune. However, Valentine is the prime suspect in her father's eyes in the deaths of the Saint-Mérans and Barrois. On learning that Morrel's son Maximilien is in love with Valentine, the Count saves her by making it appear as though Héloïse's plan to poison Valentine has succeeded. Villefort, learning from Noirtier that Héloïse is the real murderer, gives her the choice of public execution or committing suicide.

Fleeing after Caderousse's letter exposes him, Andrea is arrested and returned to Paris. Eugènie Danglars flees as well, with her girlfriend. Villefort prosecutes Andrea. Bertuccio tells Andrea, in prison, who his father is. At his trial, Andrea reveals that he is Villefort's son and was rescued after Villefort buried him alive. Villefort admits his guilt and rushes home to prevent his wife's suicide but is too late; she is dead and has poisoned her son as well. The Count confronts Villefort, revealing his true identity, which drives Villefort insane. Dantès tries but fails to resuscitate Édouard, causing him to question if his revenge has gone too far.

For his final revenge, the Count bribes a telegrapher to send a fake telegram to the Ministry of Interior stating that the pretender to the Spanish throne has returned to Barcelona to popular acclaim. This news devalues Spanish bonds in which Danglars had invested six million francs. However, after the news is proved false, Danglars ends up losing 700,000 francs, and then, another 8–900,000 after a man called Jacopo Manfredi, secretly the Count's accomplice, mysteriously goes bankrupt and fails to fulfill his obligations. Eventually, through further manipulation of the market, Danglars is left with a ruined reputation and 5,000,000 francs he has been holding in deposit for hospitals. The Count demands this sum to fulfill their credit agreement, and Danglars embezzles the hospital fund. He flees to Italy with the Count's receipt for the cash he requested from the banker Danglars, and 50,000 francs. While leaving Rome, he is kidnapped by Luigi Vampa. Forced to pay exorbitant prices for food and water, Danglars pays with his ill-gotten gains. Dantès anonymously returns the money to the hospitals, as Danglars had given their money to the Count. Danglars finally repents his crimes, and a softened Dantès forgives him and allows him to depart with his 50,000 francs.
